ESP32 Vehicle Tracking System
Overview
The ESP32 Vehicle Tracking System is a versatile project that combines various functionalities to enhance vehicle safety and security. Whether you’re monitoring a personal vehicle, fleet, or even a two-wheeler, this system provides real-time tracking, alerts, and remote control capabilities.

Features
Real-Time Location Tracking:
Utilizes a GPS module (e.g., NEO-6M) to track the vehicle’s position.
Provides accurate latitude and longitude coordinates.
Displays the location on a map interface (e.g., Blynk app).
Accident Detection:
Monitors sensor data (e.g., accelerometers) to detect sudden impacts or collisions.
Sends alerts to predefined contacts via the Blynk app or other communication channels.
Drunk Driving Alerts:
Integrates alcohol sensors or other relevant indicators.
Notifies the user if the driver is under the influence of alcohol.
Overspeeding Notifications:
Monitors vehicle speed using GPS data or other speed sensors.
Alerts the user when the vehicle exceeds a predefined speed limit.
Remote Vehicle Control:
Authorized users can remotely control the vehicle:
Engine cutoff (anti-theft feature)
Door locking/unlocking
Other customizable actions
Setup Instructions
Hardware Components:
ESP32 development board
GPS module (e.g., NEO-6M)
GSM module (e.g., SIM900A) for communication
MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope
RGB LEDs (for status indicators)
Software Dependencies:
Install necessary libraries (e.g., Blynk, MPU6050, TinyGPS++) for seamless integration.
Configure the Blynk app to receive alerts and control commands.
Code Organization:
Use your existing code as a starting point.
Organize functions for each component (e.g., accident detection, GPS tracking).
Test individual functionalities by placing them in the main loop.
Blynk Configuration:
Create a Blynk project and obtain an authentication token.
Set up Blynk widgets (buttons, notifications, maps) for interaction.
Future Enhancements
Consider expanding your system by adding more features, such as vehicle immobilization, geofencing, or integration with emergency services.
